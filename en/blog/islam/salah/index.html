    <h1>Salah</h1>
    <p>Salah (صَلاة) means prayer in Arabic.</p>
    
    <h2>Prayer.</h2>
    <p>Surah al-Fatihah (سورة ٱلْفَاتِحَة) consists of 7 Ayah (آية) (verses) which are to do with prayer, guidance and mercy.</p>
    <div id="codebox">
      <pre>
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 1:1-7</span>
1|1|In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
1|2|Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
1|3|The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
1|4|Master of the Day of Judgment.
1|5|It is You we worship, and upon You we call for help.
1|6|Guide us to the straight path.
1|7|The path of those You have blessed, not of those against whom there is anger, nor of those who are misguided.

    <h2>Direction of salah.</h2>
    <p>Direction of salah must face towards the Kaaba (الكعبة). Qibla (قبلة) is a word which means 'direction' and we use the phrase 'the qibla' (القبلة) to mean 'the direction of the Kaaba'.</p>
    <div id="codebox">
      <pre>
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 2:144</span>
We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a direction that will satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Book know that it is the Truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what they do.

    <h2>Washing (ablution).</h2>
    <ol class="arabiclist">
      <li>Do not be intoxicated ('while you are drunk').</li>
      <li>You must perform ghusl (a full bath or full shower) after sexual intercourse ('intercourse with women').</li>
      <li>You must perform wudu before your pray (wash your face, wash your hands and arms to your elbows, rub your heads with water and wipe your feet with water to your ankles) or if you wudu is broken (you are feeling un-well ('you are sick'), you are travelling ('traveling'), been to the toilet ('one of you comes from the toilet') or had sexual intercourse with someone ('intercourse with women').</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="codebox">
      <pre>
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 4:43</span>
O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer while you are drunk, so that you know what you say; nor after sexual orgasm—unless you are travelling—until you have bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 5:6</span>
O you who believe! When you rise to pray, wash your faces and your hands and arms to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then purify yourselves. If you are ill, or travelling, or one of you returns from the toilet, or you had contact with women, and could not find water, then use some clean sand and wipe your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend to burden you, but He intends to purify you, and to complete His blessing upon you, that you may be thankful.
