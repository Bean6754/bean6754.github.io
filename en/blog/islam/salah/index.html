    <h1>Salah</h1>
    <p>Salah (صَلاة) means prayer in Arabic.</p>
    
    <h2>Prayer.</h2>
    <p>Surah al-Fatihah (سورة ٱلْفَاتِحَة) consists of 7 Ayah (آية) (verses) which are to do with prayer, guidance and mercy.</p>
    <div id="codebox">
      <pre>
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 1:1-7</span>
1:1 In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
1:2 Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.
1:3 The Almighty, the Merciful.
1:4 Sovereign of the Day of Judgment.
1:5 You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help.

    <h2>Direction of salah.</h2>
    <p>Direction of salah must face towards the Kaaba (الكعبة). Qibla (قبلة) is a word which means 'direction' and we use the phrase 'the qibla' (القبلة) to mean 'the direction of the Kaaba'.</p>

<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 2:144</span>
We see the shifting of your face in the heaven; We will set for you a focal point that will be pleasing to you: "You shall set your face towards the Restricted Temple; and wherever you may be, you shall all set your faces towards it." Those who have been given the Book know it is the truth from their Lord. And God is not unaware of what you do.

    <h2>Washing (ablution).</h2>
    <ol class="arabiclist">
      <li>Do not be intoxicated ('while you are drunk').</li>
      <li>You must perform ghusl (a full bath or full shower) after sexual intercourse ('intercourse with women').</li>
      <li>You must perform wudu before your pray (wash your face, wash your hands and arms to your elbows, rub your heads with water and wipe your feet with water to your ankles) or if you wudu is broken (you are feeling un-well ('you are sick'), you are travelling ('traveling'), been to the toilet ('one of you comes from the toilet') or had sexual intercourse with someone ('intercourse with women').</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="codebox">
      <pre>
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 4:43</span>
O you who believe, do not come near the Connection while you are intoxicated, until you know what you are saying. Nor if you have had intercourse, unless a wayfarer, until you wash. And if you are ill, or traveling, or one of you has excreted feces, or you had sexual contact with the women, and could not find water, then you shall select from the clean soil; you shall wipe your faces and hands. God is Pardoning, Forgiving.
<span class="arabic-p codebox_verse">Surah 5:6</span>
O you who believe, when you attend to the Connection, then wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you have had intercourse, then you shall purify. And if you are ill, or traveling, or you have excreted feces, or you have had sexual contact with the women, and you cannot find water, then you shall select from the clean soil; you shall wipe your faces and your hands with it. God does not want to place any hardship on you, but He wants to purify you and to complete His blessings upon you that you may be thankful.
