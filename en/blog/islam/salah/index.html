1:2 - Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds;
1:3 - Most Gracious, Most Merciful;
1:4 - Master of the Day of Judgment.
1:5 - Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek.
1:6 - Show us the straight way,
1:7 - The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.
    </pre></p>

    <h2>Direction of salah.</h2>
    <p>Direction of salah must face towards the Kaaba.</p>
    <p>Surah 2:144.</p>
    <p><pre>We see the turning of thy face (for guidance to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do.</pre></p>

    <h2>Washing (ablution).</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Surah 4:43.</p>
    <p><pre>O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again.</pre></code>
    <p>Surah 5:6.</p>
    <p><pre>O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful.</pre></p>
