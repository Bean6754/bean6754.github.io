    <h1>Why Hadith Are Not Authentic</h1>

    <h2>Part 1 - Dating.</h2>
    <p>The Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (SAW) in 610-632 AD whereas the first manuscript of a Hadith was in approx. 844-1185 AD. But it's hard to tell because we don't have many old sources of Hadith.</p>
    <p>So 212-553 years after the prophets (SAW) death and after the complete Quran (assuming the Quran was right at the death of the prophet (SAW).</p>

    <h2>Part 2 - The Quran is the Complete and Final Word of Allah.</h2>
    <p>If you say you need Hadith to explain or to change the meaning of the Quran, then aren't you saying that the Quran is incomplete and needs further explanation.</p>
    <p>6:114 <pre>“Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, when He is the One who revealed to you the Book, explained in detail?” Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is the truth revealed from your Lord. So do not be of those who doubt.</pre></p>
    <p>6:115 <pre>The Word of your Lord has been completed, in truth and justice. There is no changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.</pre></p>
    <p>6:116 <pre>If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would divert you from Allah’s path. They follow nothing but assumptions, and they only conjecture.</pre></p>

    <p>33:40 <pre>Muhammad is not the father of any of your men; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of everything.</pre></p>
