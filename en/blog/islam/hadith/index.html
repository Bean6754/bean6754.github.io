    <h1>Hadith</h1>

    <p>The Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (SAW) in 610-632 AD whereas the first manuscript of a Hadith was in approx. 844-1185 AD. But it's hard to tell because we don't have many old sources of Hadith.</p>
    <p>So 212-553 years after the prophets (SAW) death and after the complete Quran (assuming the Quran was right at the death of the prophet (SAW).</p>
