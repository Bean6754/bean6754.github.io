My personal GitHub.io website.

My new focus is minimalism.

1. To use absolutely no JavaScript or PHP.

2. To use as little CSS as possible whilst still letting it suit my taste.

3. To use as little amount of images and videos as possible.

4. To keep it:
    * Clean.
    * Simple.
    * Easy.

5. To try and use HTML tags instead of bloating styles using CSS.

## For example:

Underline: Instead of `text-decoration: underline;` (CSS) use `<u></u>` tags (HTML).

Bold: Instead of `font-weight: 700;` (CSS) use `<b></b>` tags (HTML).
